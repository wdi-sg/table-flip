##### instructions

Create a game that guesses a secret word.

For this first version of your game, the secret word will be "cat".

You should simply make this an array of letters: `var secretWord = ['c','a','t'];`

Each time the user guesses wrong, another character of the table flip is added to the running total.

When the whole figure is completed then the user loses.

To get started copy the starter code files from the unit 1 template here: [https://github.com/wdi-sg/unit1-template](https://github.com/wdi-sg/unit1-template)

If you don't know how to get started, here is a sugessted function template:

- keep an array of all the table flip characters

- for each turn, an input letter should be checked in this order:

  - look through the word to guess. is the input letter there?
  - use a value set outside the searching loop to know if the letter was found 
  
  - if the guess right
    - add it to correctly guessed letters
    - the message is "you guessed right". show the letters they have so far. (no need to show them in the order they appear in the word- just show them in the order guessed)
  - otherwise the guess is wrong
    - keep track of the number of wrongly guessed letters 
    - keep an array to display the current table flip figure. it should begin empty, and added to for every wrong answer
    - take one character off the table flip characters and add it to the current table flip figure 
    - the message shows current table flip figure
    - see if the game has ended because of too many wrong guesses
        - if it has include in the message the game is over
    
    
  - show the output to the user
  
  Searching through an array is the combination of loop and conditional:
  ```js
  var list = [1,4,3,8,9,2];
  
  var numberToSearch = 2;
  
  var numberFound = false;
  
  var i=0;
  
  while( i<list.length ){
  
    if( list[i] === numberToSearch ){
    
      numberFound = true;
    }
    
    i = i+1;
  }
  
  console.log( "number found: "+numberFound );
  
  ```
  
  ### further
  Make a list of words to guess. It will be in increasing difficulty. It will be an array of arrays:
  
  ```
  var words = [
    ['c','a','t'],
    ['d','o','g','g','y'],
    ['a','l','p','h','a','b','e','t']
  ];
  ```
  
  ### further
  Replace all the arrays of letters with `split('')`
  
  ```
  var word = 'rat';
  var letterArray = word.split(''); // ['r','a','t']
  ```
  ### further
  Format the output of the message. Use array join to join the array characters of the table flip figure.
  ```js
  var word = ['c','a','t'];
  
  word.join() // outputs 'cat'
  ```
  
  ### further
  If the user guesses a letter correctly, show the letters in their place in the word.
  
  For example:
  - Word is: phone
  - User guesses n
  - message shown is: `_ _ _ n _`
  
  Hint: you can set a value in a *location* in an array, without setting previous values:
  ```js
  var word = ['c','a','t'];
  var correctGuesses = [];
  var userGuess = 't';
  
  /*
    search through the word and 
    find the index of the letter in the word array
    in this case, it's 2
  */
  
  correctGuesses[2] = userGuess;
  ```
  
  ### further
  Make the game more lenient.
  
  The wrong guesses will first make this emoticon: ┳━┳
  
  Then this emoticon: (ರ ~ ರ）┳━┳
  
  Then if more wrong guesses are made it changes to this one: (╯ರ ~ ರ）╯︵ ┻━┻
  
  Then the game ends.
  
  ### further
  The user can type 'admin' to get to an admin mode.
  
  Here they will be able to enter in words, one at a time to add to the list of words to guess.
  
  Then when they type 'endadmin', the admnin mode will end.
